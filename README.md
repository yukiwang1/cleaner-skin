## About Cleaner Skin

As an avid consumer of beauty products, I always found the ingredients labels of skincare products to be confusing to understand. These products are often marketed as natural, sulfate-free, paraben-free, and fragrance-free, but I wanted to know if there were ingredients present that weren't being advertised, but rather hidden in the ingredients labels. I found that there wasn't a standalone tool that could be used to analyze a list of ingredients and clearly show whether it contained any potential health risks.
